CS203 Project Proposal

1.Q-M solver

A.   As the name suggests we will be making a web based application that can take input from users 
and minimise it using Q-M method.
B.   In addition, we will be also implementing another helping function which will help users to 
compare two boolean expressions, users are supposed to type two or more boolean expressions then we 
can say how many of them lead to the same expression.
C.  We will use html ,css , javascript and some frameworks like react or angular for making web app 
interactive. We can also use frameworks like Flask web apps framework for the same.
